// Retire one seed-backed module: rewrite every relative importer to the alias, then delete the FILE —
// and only the file. The recipe, executable, so a tranche cannot drift from it by hand.
//
//   node scripts/retire-module.mjs shared/ui/controls/Button [--dry]
//
// THE COLOCATED TEST STAYS. Its relative import is rewritten like any other importer, after which it
// resolves through `tsconfig.paths` to the emitted `.bsc-records/` copy and the default gate goes on
// running it — against the module that actually ships, which is better coverage than it had. Deleting it
// would move its assertions into the record's `tests` data, where nothing in the gate executes them; that
// cost 31 assertions across the first two tranches. `src/app/runtime/retiredTests.test.ts` guards it.
//
// AFTERWARDS, run `node scripts/sync-shadow-catalogue.mjs` — a module catalogued in `shadowPages.ts`
// must become `file: null` and leave its glob, or `shadowPages.test.ts` fails. It is a separate sweep
// because it reconciles the whole catalogue against disk in one pass, which is cheaper and safer than
// each retirement editing the same file.
//
// It rewrites `vi.mock("./x")` too, and that is not a nicety. A mock keys on the RESOLVED module, so when
// the consumer imports `@/a/b` while the test mocks `./b`, retiring the file makes those stop being the
// same module — and the mock SILENTLY STOPS APPLYING. The test still runs; it just exercises the real
// module against a fixture built for a fake. Four tests broke that way on the first 110-file tranche
// (`graphBridge`, `uiActivity`), and failing loudly was luck rather than design: a mock that quietly stops
// mocking usually just makes a test weaker.
//
// Quote-agnostic on purpose: a double-quote-only sweep missed `PreviewPaneShell.tsx`'s
// `from './StageScreenFrame'` and the typecheck found it instead. Rewriting is still not a substitute for
// running tsc afterwards — this handles the mechanical bulk, tsc is the oracle.
